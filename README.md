Let me start by saying, I am **VERY** new to Python, HTML, and GitHub so please feel free to give me any advise you may have!

This is an awesome simple project if you are just starting with python, 3D printing or Raspberry Pis.
 
I really wanted some home automation, but I live in a rented apartment and it turns out they really frown upon you messing with the apartment's wiring
;-p.``

So I've designed a small bracket that attaches to your existing light switch plate that holds a micro servo which can turn on and off a paddle style light switch.

This is a simple flask server for a Raspberry Pi (or other single board computers) that can control that micro servo via a web interface over your local network! Without messing with any existing electrical work!

See Thingiverse.com post (I will post the link as soon as I make it)for the micro servo switch plate mount.

**MAKE SURE TO CHANGE ALL OF MY IP ADDRESSES TO YOUR PI'S LOCAL ADDRESS!!**

Use the **test.py** to determine the correct ON/OFF angles for the servo. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you have some advise for a newbie like me!
